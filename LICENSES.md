## Logos and Wordmarks
- No standalone logo assets are stored in the repository. All partner/product references (Perplexity AI, Qwen AI, Blender, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, Hugging Face, T-FLEX CAD, NotebookLM) are currently text-only links without embedded graphics.
- The NotebookLM entry is a temporary text placeholder until Google releases official embeddable assets for public use.
- When vendor or Wikimedia-hosted logo files are added, record their direct source URLs and licensing terms (e.g., specific CC BY version or vendor kit EULA) here before publication.

## Photography and Other Media
- Local gallery images in `images/lab/1.jpg`–`6.jpg` are supplied as internal placeholders. Replace them with owned or appropriately licensed imagery before release.
- No externally downloaded media with attribution requirements (e.g., CC BY) are bundled at this time.
